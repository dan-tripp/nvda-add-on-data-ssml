    /* to test encoding chars, the process ought to be something like this:
	- for each char, put it in this test page repeated at least 300 times, then read through the page w/ nvda arrow keys and see what the synth gets.  
		- make sure the synth gets the string at all 
		- make sure the synth gets that repeated char as a string of approx len 100 or greater (300 is ok)  
			- regarding that number "100": there are some things going on here that I don't understand.  this comment was originally written in march 2025, when we were patching the speech synth - before we started using the extension points API (~ 2025-05-24).  that number 100 might have been true then.  I've seen it be not true now (written nov 2025) - w/ the extension points api, our hook often sees a 300-len string.  but not always.  I temporarily added back in a patch to the speech synth (in addition to our extensions API filter) and then I often saw the speech synth and our filter get 100-len strings.  often, but not always.  sometimes they still saw 300.  this might've depending on the browser zoom level.  even this wasn't consistent.  then I gave up trying to understand this particular sub-point. 
	- this test page does this below. 
	- reasons
		- "abc abc abc" etc. reaches the synth in 101-char strings. 
		- "abcabcabc" etc. reaches the synth in 102-char strings. 
		- ^^ I tested both on all 3 synths 
		- when I was using the bad encoding chars u180e, it didn't show up at all when I repeated it > 300 times. 
	- this page/process doesn't do the thing that originally told me that u180e was bad: when it's used normally (i.e. not repeated, but instead appearing amongst other chars) then sometimes it works fine but sometimes it works badly in the sense that it still appears but split up strings to the synth sometimes.  it always appeared as the last (or last-before-a-space? I forget) char in the first string of the split.  synth got len 96-82 strings then, w/ strings always ending w/ u180e.
