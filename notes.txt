
handle arrows not just tab 
get data-ssl from the DOM 
parse SSML 
PhonemeCommand 
	- "Note that this is not well supported by synthesizers." 
speakSsml() 
	- does it handle phoneme? 
announce "link" or "button" or whatever, as usual. 
bug?  my phoneme doesn't appear in the speech viewer. 
handle browsers only 
handle live regions 
handle this: focusEntered: Focus has moved inside this object; i.e. it is an ancestor of the focus object
propagate ? 
handle diff ssml for accName and innert text.  where to put those two ssml docs?  
notes from ETS CSUN talk 
	- example from pic 2025-03-13
		- it's a <label> for a radio button AFAICS 
		- <label for="...">the pre-<span data-ssml='{"sub": "alias": "m r n A"}}'>mRNA</span> is cleaved...</label> 
			- all others on this slide are sub/alias.  no say-as-characeters, no phonemes. 
	- binary example 10110 
	- phone number spaces?  can't remember if they mentioned. 
	- other speakers email addrs in pic.  
what happens inside role=application?  
caret browsing 
big picture: what can I accomplish that wouldn't be accomplished through a user-defined dictionary which uses SSML? 
am I playing nice w/ other plugins? 
websocket between add-on and bext 
bext, websocket, smuggling out the dom 
possible to get a native app to use ssml?  if so, how? 
Tree Interceptor   might let me get closer to the dom 
deal w/ my license b/c I'm copying from mathcatforpython and it seems to be largely gpl 
ssml in json (AOT xml) as per csun talk 
handle forms mode 
handle nvda commands that "list things" eg. list links, form fields, headings?  
plugin script property: speakOnDemand
i18n 
don't interfere with braille output 
	- chatgpt says that it's common to temporarily disable speech then call nextHandler then restore speech.  monkey patch speech.speak w/ a no-op func. 
f: onecore announced wound/wound correctly.  other synths didn't.  all 3 synths in supportedCommands had PhonemeCommand.
f: mathcat code: "# as of 7/23, oneCore voices do not implement the CharacterModeCommand despite it being in supported_commands" 
	- verified by experiment 2025-03-22 

------------- old but not useless below this line ----------- 

mathcat  
	- does mathcat use ssml? 
	- license unclear.  mit and/or gpl. 


sleep mode: CAPS+s
